This experiment was performed to determine if OrNV isolate V23B can be transmitted from a dosed CRB adult to an undosed CRB 
adult.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Beetles}

\subsection{Virus}

Beetles were dosed per os with ca. 30 microlitre V23B virus preparation of unknown concentration (AgResearch, New Zealand).

\subsection{Experimental design}

To test for virus transmission, beetles were selected at random and assigned to 45 pairs with a male and a female 
in each pair. These pairs were housed in Mason jars half filled with moist peat moss. The jars were held under 
standard rearing conditions in an environmental chamber: 30 deg C; 80\% RH; 12h photoperiod. At the start of the 
bioassay, the beetle pairs were randomly placed in 3 treatment groups of 15 jars each.

    Jars labeled MF1 through MF15 & Female was dosed with virus; male was not dosed\\
